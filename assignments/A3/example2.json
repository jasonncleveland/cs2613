Nowadays the appropriate way\nto disable an init script is to remove the 'S' links without removing\nthe 'K' links, for example by running\n\n\tupdate-rc.d foo disable\n\nUnfortunately:\n\n 1. That is not as well known is it ought to be.  For example, section\n    4.6.3. \"Restricting access to some server services\"[1] of\n    debian-reference could be clarified to emphasize this method.\n\n 2. Many packages seem to provide ENABLE/DISABLE variables in\n    /etc/default/foo, providing a confusing red herring for this\n    task --- a second method which does not work nearly as well,\n    as you pointed out.\n\n 3. The tempting \"update-rc.d foo remove\" (which removes the 'K'\n    links, too) might _seem_ to work, except that the next time the\n    foo package is upgraded, the service is back again.\n\nOne possible way to move forward would be to write a patch to the\ndebian reference and any other pertinent documentation to address (1)\nand (3) and (once consensus that this is a good idea is reached) to\nfile bugs requesting removal of the ENABLE/DISABLE vars to address (2),\nblocking this bug by them.  When the last such variable is eliminated\nfrom the default conffiles in /etc/default, this bug could be closed.\n\nA complicating factor is that the sysadmin may already have customized\nsome ENABLE/DISABLE settings and a move like this should not override\ntheir settings.  So perhaps packages should stop advertising the\nENABLE/DISABLE vars in /etc/default/<package>, but continue to respect\nthem when set.\n\nSane?\n\nThanks,\nJonathan\n\n[1] http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch04.en.html#_restricting_access_to_some_server_services\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-devel-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

However, I also think we need a system-wide policy mechanism to\nallow the sysadmin to say \"start things by default\" or \"don't start\nthings by default\". Similar to systemd's \"preset\" mechanism, and ideally\nusing that under systemd, but providing the same level of control for\nnon-systemd init systems.\n\n> > > +An older practice, which should not be used, was to include a line\n> > > +like ``DISABLED=yes`` in the package's ``/etc/default`` file.

They also make it difficult to\nprogrammatically configure services, such as by dropping in a\nconfiguration .d file from a configuration package.\n\n"
