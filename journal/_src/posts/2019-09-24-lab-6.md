## Hash Tables

The first section in this lab looked at hash tables. We started out looking at the `hash` keyword which takes in key value pairs. We then looked at `hash-ref` which is used to retrieve the value stored for a given key. To update a hash table we can use `hash-set`. This command replaces the value stored in the hash table with the new value.

Using the new keywords and knowledge of hash tables, we created a function called *census* to count the occurrences of strings in a list. This function used the values in the list as keys and stored a number as the value. Each time an occurrence of the string was found the number was incremented by 1.

## Explorer

This next section looked at the `explore` keyword. The `explore` keyword allows us to break down code and look at the individual components and lower-level function calls that make the code work. This is useful for debugging.

## Plotting

The plotting section of this lab looked at plotting values on a 2D graph. Using the calculus.rkt file created in lab 5, we turned it into an exportable module and plotted the difference in values for the derivative of sin x and cos x. We used sin -2pi to plot the derivative of sin x at y = 1 but this had to be changed to cos pi/2 for the derivative of cos x. This is because the value of sin -2pi and cos pi/2 are 0. This makes the plot a flat line.

## Discussion

This lab looked at two kinds of visualization; explore, and plotting. Explore would be most useful during the debugging stage of development. It allows code to be broken down into individual components to see where an underlying issue might be. Plotting, on the other hand, is useful during the testing stage. It allows developers to take data that is run through the program and display it in an easy to understand format. This is a lot easire to understand than unit tests that only take in numbers.

## JSON

The final section of this lab looked at JSON. JSON is a data storage format used to easily store and transfer data objects. Using the file `errors.json`, we created a function to extract the status of each error into a list. This section was challenging figuring out the nested `hash-ref` calls. I started out by creating a loop over the elements inside of the error key and then using `map` to extract the status value.
