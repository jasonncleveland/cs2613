I think I took linear algebra once. It definitely didn't help with this lab.

## Working With Grids

Lab 21 started of with an introduction of some Octave syntax that will be used in later sections.

### Range

Octave allows us to create an array of numbers using `[-1:0.5:1]` syntax. This creates an array containing all numbers from -1 to 1 in 0.5 intervals. For example, *[-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]*.

### Meshgrid

Meshgrid is a builtin function that takes in two arrays and meshes them into a single parallel array. For example, `[X,Y] = meshgrid(r,r)`. This example allows us to assign multiple variables.

We then looked at the dot operation. Calling `X.^2` where X is an array will square all values to X. Simply, `.` tells Octave to do whatever operation to all elements.

## Defining and Testing a Function

With the newfound knowledge we looked at creating a function to evaluate the following function: *δ(β, a, b) = βa·b - (β-1)b·b*. To accomplish this we used Octave's `dot` function to calculate the necessary dot products.

In lab 20 we explored how to create tests using basic syntax: `%!assert (1 == 2-1);`. Lab 21 expanded upon that by introducing multi-line tests. This allows us to set up a test by initializing variables. We are also introduced to error tolerance. This is similar to Racket when a floating point value is passed in and the values are checked to be within that value of each other. In Racket we hadto create this value. Octave however, has a built in `eps` variable that we can simply pass to our tests.

```matlab
%% delta(0,a,b) = |b|²
%!test
%! a = rand(2,1)
%! b = rand(2,1)
%! assert(delta(0,a,b), norm(b)^2, eps)
```

## Making 3D Plots

The next part of the lab takes the delta function and uses it to build a #D surface map. The X and Y were created using the range function and then a Z was created using a **beta** value of **7.5** and an **a** array of **[4;4]**. This created a nice parabolic plot.

## Using `arrayfun`

The previous lab section used for loops to accomplish the Z array creation. In this part we looked at accomplishing the same using the `arrayfun` function and an anonymous function. The `arrayfun` function takes a function and applies it to the passed array. Example: `arrayfun(delta, X)`. We can then create an anonymous function to pass to arrayfun. Anonymous functions have special syntax like many other languages. The below example calls `arrayfun` which iterates over both X and Y arrays and applies the anonymous to them. This is very similar to using the `map` or `reduce` functions in Python with a lambda function.

```matlab
f = @(x,y)(delta(beta, a, [x;y]));
Z = arrayfun(X,Y);
```

## Fully Vectorizing

This last part is voodo magic. We were given the following `Z(i,j) = beta * (a(1)*X(i,j) + a(2)*Y(i,j)) - (beta-1) * (X(i,j)^2 + Y(i,j)^2)` which is a single iteration of a call to delta. Our task was to convert this into a simple function `arraydelta`. This can be done by modifying the given statement and returning its result. Replacing the calls to `X(i,j)` and `Y(i,j)` with `X.` and `Y.` tells Octave to apply the calculations to allow values in X and Y. Since this is a builtin library function there is a dramatic improvement in speed compared to the previous two interpreted solutions.

```matlab
Z(i,j) = beta * (a(1)*X(i,j) + a(2)*Y(i,j)) - (beta-1) * (X(i,j)^2 + Y(i,j)^2)

to

Z = beta * (a(1).*X + a(2).*Y) - (beta-1) * (X.^2 + Y.^2)
```
