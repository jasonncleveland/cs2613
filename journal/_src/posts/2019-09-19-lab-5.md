## Tail Recursion

The first **odds-evens** functions uses a lot of the stack. It adds each new execution of the function to the stack. This results in <number> of stack frames added.

The second **odds-evens2** function is much more stack effecient. It adds the calls to the helper function to the stack but they don't stick around nearly as long as the stack frames in the first function. There are never more than 3 items on the stack for **odds-evens2**

## For Loops

In this section we looked at how to create and use for loops. **talk about how for loops work**. After implementing **odds-evens3** using a foor loop we looked into time comparison.

## Racket Review

New functions:

- `range`

- `time`

New forms:

- `for*`

- `for`

- `for/fold`

New concepts

- tail recursion

- accumulator

## Numerical Integration

This next part uses calculus to reinforce the ideas or tail recursion and for loops. In the part we also explored unit tests more. We learned about `check-=` which allows for margin of error. `check-=` takes in an error argument and checks if the results are within the given value plus or minus the margin of error. This is extremely useful when dealing with small numbers that can vary after a couple of decimal place
